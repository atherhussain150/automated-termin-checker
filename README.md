# Personal Appointment Finder for Driver's License

This script is a personal project developed to help me find an appointment for my driver's license. It automates the process of checking for available appointments on a specific website and alerts me if any appointments are found.

## Description

The Personal Appointment Finder for Driver's License is a Python script created with the purpose of simplifying the task of searching for available appointments for driver's license-related services. It uses Selenium WebDriver to navigate the website and search for appointment slots based on my predefined criteria.
I created this to because it is difficult to get appointments for license pickup, renewals and even first registration as the appoints are usually available for dates after 6 to 8 months but sometimes same / next week appointments are freed but this happens at random on thursdays and fridays. I made this script to check for the appointments automatically instead of doing it manually.

## Features

- Automatically navigates to the appointment booking page
- Inputs my postal code and selects options as needed
- Checks for available appointments in a specified month
- Alerts me if appointments are found

Essentially the script is a macro to send inputs and clicks to get to the page where the appointments are shown.
